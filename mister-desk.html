<h1>Side 1 Lyrics.</h1>
<h2>1. Indestructible</h2>
<p class="lyrics">brick by brick, pane by pane<br />
raise the housing for students inlaid<br />
started with a flicker<br />
and grew into a flame<br />
a culture so emboldened<br />
put a fear into that fame<br />
<br />
all they know, a place called home<br />
in the heart of darkness<br />
was a light hard as stone<br />
the place was safer<br />
while things got harder<br />
they all tried<br />
to get a little bit farther<br />
<br />
indestructible, indestructible<br />
concrete was poured<br />
and the soul was formed<br />
we made something out of nothing<br />
collective swarm on us no hold<br />
<br />
from early morning<br />
to late into the night<br />
souls pressed together<br />
pushing deep into that night<br />
<br />
all they know was a place called home<br />
they all tried, they all tried.<br />
<br />
indestructible, indestructible<br />
concrete was poured<br />
and the soul was formed<br />
we made something out of nothing<br />
collective swarm on us no hold<br />
<br />
misfits who never knew<br />
what friends could mean<br />
people they embraced<br />
in their true being<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
indestructible, indestructible<br />
concrete was poured<br />
and the soul was formed<br />
we made something out of nothing<br />
collective swarm on us no hold</p>
<h2>2. In My Soul</h2>
<p class="lyrics">i'm addicted to a certain kind of day<br />
it's scaring me, will i always be this way?<br />
<br />
in my soul i know a change is gonna come<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's already noon<br />
in my soul i know it's why i'm feeling blue<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's ending all too soon<br />
<br />
my headache's coming on<br />
and my blood boiling up<br />
the body's rotting in the grave<br />
but this life ain't over yet<br />
<br />
in my soul i know a change is gonna come<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's already noon<br />
in my soul i know it's cuz i'm feeling blue<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's ending all too soon<br />
<br />
another day, another way<br />
sleeping in a new place<br />
counting til i'm driving home<br />
and trying to find my new grace<br />
<br />
in my soul i know a change is gonna come<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's already noon<br />
in my soul i know it's why i'm feeling blue<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's ending all too soon<br />
<br />
my thoughts are that   <br />
of an old man out at sea<br />
looking down, so caring and so free<br />
he won't be<br />
<br />
in my soul i know a change is gonna come<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's already noon<br />
in my soul i know it's why i'm feeling blue<br />
what luck, aw shucks.<br />
<br />
in my soul i know a change is comin' soon<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's already noon<br />
in my soul i know it's why i'm feeling blue<br />
what luck, aw shucks, it's ending all too soon!</p>
<h2>3. Beautiful Summer</h2>
<p class="lyrics">i hear you're having a beautiful summer<br />
with all your beautiful friends<br />
spreadin' tales of your beautiful lovers<br />
and how they get you there<br />
<br />
oh yes, it seems so perfect<br />
from the outside looking in<br />
oh, it seems uncertain<br />
what's real and what's pretend<br />
<br />
beautiful summer<br />
beautiful summer<br />
beautiful summer<br />
<br />
i know you're having a beautiful summer<br />
you tell me everyday<br />
they pry and pry, those curious minds<br />
guess that's the price you pay<br />
    <br />
you made the grass look greener<br />
you can see it in their eyes<br />
but who will cross the line<br />
to take a peek on the other side?<br />
<br />
beautiful summer<br />
beautiful summer<br />
beautiful summer<br />
<br />
[organ solo]<br />
<br />
they pull the string, it breaks the spell<br />
and you know it's time to go<br />
you pack your bags, escape this hell<br />
and call the curtains on the show<br />
call the curtains on the show<br />
<br />
i hope you're having a beautiful summer<br />
somehow, somewhere<br />
far away from the fame and the glory<br />
where no-one can sit and stare<br />
<br />
beautiful summer [repeat to fade out]
</p>
<h2>4. Think About You?</h2>
<p class="lyrics">backwoods and faded dreams<br />
old times getting older it seems<br />
why ain't you the same to me<br />
the past isn't past to thee<br />
and i go back to the tree<br />
but you ain't there for me<br />
i go searching about<br />
broke glass all abound<br />
memories you said to me<br />
swing back and come home<br />
'fore I'll know<br />
that you'll be there for me<br />
<br />
as dark turns into day<br />
i find my mind's ablaze a million miles away<br />
will i be thinking 'bout you?<br />
as day turns into night<br />
and the sun hides so all the stars fade into view<br />
will i still think about you?<br />
<br />
i mind throughout the day<br />
i'll be thinking, still thinking<br />
about my AAA<br />
a battery refills me<br />
i'll be moving, still moving<br />
moving on<br />
passing cars and passing days<br />
a million holidays gone away<br />
history class has been teaching me<br />
about my life that's meant to be<br />
i mind throughout the day<br />
i'll be thinking, still thinking<br />
about my AAA<br />
<br />
as dark turns into day<br />
i find my mind's ablaze a million miles away<br />
will i be thinking 'bout you?<br />
as day turns into night<br />
and the sun hides so all the stars fade into view<br />
will i still think about you?<br />
<br />
[harmonica solo]<br />
<br />
everybody needs some distraction<br />
everybody needs a second view<br />
everybody's trying to second guess you<br />
like they're meant to, oh yeah<br />
<br />
holding myself against the moon<br />
i sing of love, oh once, so true<br />
<br />
as dark turns into day<br />
i find my mind's ablaze a million miles away<br />
will i be thinking 'bout you?<br />
as day turns into night<br />
and the sun hides so all the stars fade into view<br />
will i still think about you?<br />
<br />
i think you said you weren't listening<br />
but i wasn't listening to you<br />
(will i be thinking 'bout you)<br />
i think you think i wasn't meaning it<br />
i wasn't meaning it, it's true<br />
(will i be thinking 'bout you)<br />
i think you said you weren't listening<br />
but i wasn't listening to you<br />
(will i be thinking 'bout you)<br />
i think you think i wasn't meaning it<br />
i wasn't meaning it, it's true<br />
(will i be thinking 'bout you)
</p>
<h2>5. Another Sleepless Night</h2>
<p class="lyrics">despite my best efforts<br />
it's another sleepless night<br />
you said everything was going to be alright<br />
<br />
armed with best laid plans<br />
as prepared as we could be<br />
only god herself could see<br />
when the seams start falling apart<br />
it's unraveled, it's undone<br />
and we all know what's to come<br />
<br />
despite my best efforts<br />
it's another sleepless night<br />
you said everything was going to be alright<br />
to my great displeasure<br />
we've gone down this road once more<br />
so i'll see you in the morning<br />
<br />
trying hard to make things right<br />
under these fluorescent lights<br />
call it "conquering the night"<br />
every moment passing by<br />
nothing brings us any closer<br />
to getting it right<br />
<br />
go ahead and call it a night<br />
i can see the betrayal in your eyes<br />
the beauty of sunrise<br />
is tempered by my decline<br />
<br />
so it's come to this again<br />
now it's time to flip the switch<br />
emergency reserve<br />
a second wind<br />
it's time to stop<br />
screwing around<br />
but i want you to know<br />
now i want you to know<br />
<br />
that now you've found me<br />
i'm in my element<br />
and yes you've found me<br />
i'm in my element<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
you're racked with indecision<br />
facing stubborn friction<br />
we can be friends when the sun comes out<br />
unsustainable condition<br />
time to make the last incision<br />
but i want you to know<br />
now i want you to know<br />
<br />
that now you've found me<br />
i'm in my element<br />
and yes you've found me<br />
i'm in my element<br />
but now you've found me<br />
i'm in my element<br />
i'm in my element, in my element, in my<br />

<h1>Side 2 Lyrics.</h1>
<h2>6. Abstract Art</h2>
<p class="lyrics">passing time 'til another day's gone<br />
but it won't get me down<br />
gonna go live it my way<br />
<br />
abstract art is hanging on the wall<br />
won't stop for anything<br />
pushing through 'til another day<br />
a new goal in my way<br />
<br />
freedom, freedom<br />
freedom, freedom<br />
beautiful world, beautiful cold<br />
who knows what i'll see myself<br />
it's abstract art<br />
traveling down this freeway of life<br />
breaking down the doors, & yelling i'm home<br />
<br />
what's that hanging on the wall<br />
it's abstract art in the hall<br />
but i know<br />
<br />
it's not for me<br />
know that i'm gonna be free<br />
<br />
anything goes, it ebbs and it flows<br />
it breaks and it bows, it gets home<br />
<br />
what's that hanging on the wall<br />
it's abstract art</p>
<h2>7. Never Too Late</h2>
<p class="lyrics">molten steel pours my form<br />
taking free life away<br />
ask yourself where you're born<br />
it's all the same<br />
a soul a ghost<br />
a woman so brave<br />
she lights up his world<br />
she makes him feel brave<br />
<br />
it's never too late<br />
it's never too late<br />
you said to me<br />
we'd always be<br />
<br />
the light creative kid<br />
burnt a little hole<br />
it is he our son<br />
who brightens up their world<br />
and the creative man<br />
burns up it all<br />
he our son<br />
who brightens up their world<br />
so he can have some fun<br />
<br />
it's never too late<br />
it's never too late<br />
to this i'll agree<br />
a better man, wait and see<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
woe is a thing to chase<br />
when i've turned to dust<br />
never penned letters<br />
to those who you once just loved<br />
<br />
those once stopped,<br />
they're never determined<br />
once called their end<br />
she was the one<br />
she was the one to me<br />
<br />
it's never too late<br />
it's never too late<br />
she said to me<br />
you'll always be<br />
<br />
it's never too late<br />
it's never too late<br />
you'd say i agree<br />
a better man, wait and see</p>
<h2>8. Jabberwocky</h2>
<p class="lyrics">information breakdown<br />
it's never the same<br />
20 different sources<br />
all over the place<br />
<br />
"everything is dangerous.<br />
step into my rabbit hole,<br />
a bunker for the end of the world."<br />
<br />
it's a hard thing to gain<br />
my trust, in this world<br />
your tribe, my tribe<br />
give it all away<br />
<br />
all those open channels<br />
the bands we see are closing<br />
all those closing channels<br />
width a single signal<br />
<br />
"what are you doing standing there?<br />
we'll have a grand old time!<br />
everybody's waiting on you<br />
everybody's waiting on you now!"<br />
<br />
i'm right and i'm wrong and i might be so wrong<br />
i'm right and i'm wrong and i might be so right<br />
when is the world gonna come back around<br />
when is the world gonna come back down<br />
when will we all just get along<br />
when will we all just get along<br />
oh no<br />
<br />
the cards we play<br />
what do they mean<br />
the words they say<br />
what do they mean<br />
<br />
"no need to worry<br />
we'll teach you everything we know<br />
aren't you glad this madness<br />
has such a pretty bow?"<br />
<br />
they're insecure<br />
and it allures<br />
i'm controversial<br />
reactionarial<br />
<br />
i might be naive<br />
i might be naive<br />
but that's the world<br />
i want to live in<br />
<br />
i might be naive<br />
i might be naive<br />
but that's the world<br />
i want to live in<br />
<br />
i'm right and i'm wrong and i might be so wrong<br />
i'm right and i'm wrong and i might be so right<br />
when is the world gonna come back around<br />
when is the world gonna come back down<br />
when will we all just get along<br />
when will we all just get along<br />
<br />
"this is your destiny.<br />
you were meant to be here.<br />
don't disappoint me now.<br />
you were born to do this."<br />
<br />
crawling out<br />
(come on up and see the light)<br />
i see the light<br />
is it too late to turn back now<br />
is it too late to turn back now<br />
is it too late to turn back now<br />
is it too late to turn back now<br />
<br />

<h2>9. Richard Russell</h2>
<p class="lyrics">i'm a man in crisis<br />
i got a few screws loose<br />
and i never really knew until today<br />
the boys up in the tower<br />
they wanna get me on the ground<br />
i'd rather see what this bad boy can do<br />
<br />
and i don't think that i'll be coming down tonight<br />
cuz i've seen it all before<br />
and i think i know where this is going<br />
i don't think that you'll be seeing me again<br />
but you should come and see me now, my friend<br />
<br />
and it feels so good<br />
flying high above the sound<br />
and i know you would<br />
if you spent every day doing the same old thing<br />
<br />
i don't think that i'll be coming down tonight<br />
cuz i've seen it all before<br />
and i think i know where this is going<br />
i don't think that you'll be seeing me again<br />
but you should come and see me now, my friend<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
i'm a man in crisis<br />
to those of you i love<br />
i'm sorry that i let you down<br />
<br />
i don't think that i'll be coming down tonight<br />
cuz i've seen it all before<br />
and i think i know where this is going<br />
i don't think that you'll be seeing me again<br />
yeah i think this is the end.
</p>
<h2>10. Life After</h2>
<p class="lyrics">(Attention passengers:<br />
The next Red Line train to Alewife<br />
is now arriving.)<br />
    <br />
you will see me again in that old place<br />
touch me again in that old way<br />
i'm feeling you now on your grave<br />
i'm alone this time, please stay<br />
<br />
love me, the world is full of beauty<br />
and crashing down dreams into me<br />
the end of the road is there<br />
attempts to try so sincere<br />
my life is in your hands<br />
<br />
got to find a way to move on<br />
my own light, my right to life<br />
must break this chain<br />
that holds me down<br />
i've left those days behind me<br />
<br />
passing seasons change<br />
i will not move<br />
my head's on tight<br />
i'm alright with this tune<br />
alright with this tune<br />
<br />
as subways trains pass<br />
it's all a blur<br />
as they go past<br />
my life after<br />
my life after<br />
<br />
making life worth living<br />
and finding art worth keeping<br />
having friends worth seeing<br />
it's alright<br />
<br />
make this life worth living<br />
(life worth living)<br />
find art worth keeping<br />
(art worth keeping)<br />
have friends worth seeing<br />
(friends worth seeing)<br />
it's alright<br />
(alright)<br />
<br />
give me peace<br />
give me tranquility<br />
i'm sorry<br />
i'll make it up this time<br />
i'll make it, i'll make it up this time<br />
this time<br />
<br />
in the darkness, nothing changes<br />
it's sinister evil<br />
those people smile, not smiling at me<br />
as we jump into the sea<br />
<br />
turn the lights out<br />
grab a bat now<br />
i swing it hard and shout<br />
it's not working<br />
<br />
(this will pass) i don't know how<br />
(this will pass) i don't want it to<br />
<br />
make this life worth living<br />
find art worth keeping<br />
have friends worth seeing<br />
it's alright<br />
<br />
give me peace<br />
give me tranquility<br />
i'm sorry<br />
i'll make it up this time<br />
i'll make it, i'll make it up this time<br />
i'll make it, i'll make it<br />
i'll make it up this time<br />
<br />
(one final thing i have to do<br />
and then i'll be free of the past)
