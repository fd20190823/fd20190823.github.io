<h2>1. This Time</h2>
<p class="lyrics">this time is the last time<br />
you're gonna say those words to me<br />
next time, better find out<br />
what's gonna make it work for me<br />
<br />
and i can't seem to figure it out<br />
don't you know what i'm talking about?<br />
<br />
you said on the telephone<br />
ain't gonna take my shit no more<br />
not then, but in six weeks<br />
i felt bad but i can't look back now<br />
<br />
and i can't seem to figure it out<br />
it just makes me wanna shout shout shout<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
this time is the last time<br />
you're gonna say those words to me<br />
<br />
next time, better find out<br />
what's gonna make it work for me<br />
<br />
and i can't seem to figure it out<br />
can't you tell me what it's all about</p>
<h2>2. Machine</h2>
<p class="lyrics">we see the sun<br />
we soak it in<br />
we start our day<br />
with bright thoughts in our hair<br />
<br />
you might look down<br />
i might help you<br />
sometimes i forget<br />
no matter what<br />
<br />
everyday's a blessing<br />
machine is listening<br />
<br />
roll the dice, shine the shoes<br />
to you i swear it feels like heaven<br />
<br />
step into the cold and feel the snow<br />
that's no son, it's your father<br />
<br />
everyday's a blessing<br />
machine is listening<br />
<br />
we see the sun<br />
we soak it in<br />
we start our day<br />
with bright thoughts in our hair</p>
<h2>3. Silicon Valley Blues</h2>
<p class="lyrics">microsoft is a cold hearted company<br />
they'll take away your girlfriend down to the sea<br />
hooked up with some guy down by the shore<br />
now i don't want to see her anymore<br />
<br />
successful people make me nervous<br />
the system moves too fast to make me deserve this<br />
<br />
silicon valley blues is quite the disease<br />
how much money will set you free?<br />
a real cause to act is just the medicine you need<br />
you will give and not receive<br />
<br />
i see her in that warm summer dress<br />
as someone to confide to, never control<br />
asked to take her down to that shore<br />
now i want to see her once more<br />
<br />
only so many jobs, what do i do<br />
only so many girls, what should you do<br />
only so many fights, which do you pick<br />
which do i pick?<br />
<br />
silicon valley blues is quite the disease<br />
how much money will set you free?<br />
a real cause to act is just the medicine you need<br />
you will give and not receive<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
an open door to anywhere in the world<br />
work wherever you want, plant your feet<br />
when opportunities knock don't stay inside<br />
push through to the other side<br />
<br />
silicon valley blues is quite the disease<br />
how much money will set you free?<br />
a real cause to act is just the medicine you need<br />
you will give and not receive

<h2>4. Bureaucrats</h2>
<p class="lyrics">what form is this? the 1079-B form? oh no, that's not right. what you need is the 1079-D form. as in dog? didn't you read the brochure? have a good one. oh no, see, that's just a copying artifact. it's a smudge. that's supposed to be a D. you can come back with the correct form next month.<br />
<br />
cuz we're the bureaucrats<br />
yes we're the bureaucrats<br />
<br />
thank you for riding copernicus airlines! your happiness and safety are very important to us. unfortunately, all of our planes at this airport are missing their engines, so we have cancelled all outgoing flights for the rest of the day. because of the anticipated load on our employees, we are also closing all of our help desks. once again, we thank you for choosing copernicus airlines and we hope you have a wonderful day.<br />
<br />
cuz we're the bureaucrats<br />
yes we're the bureaucrats<br />
our job is to protect the machine<br />
armed with a million pages of policy<br />
and if you get in our way, we're going to ruin your day<br />
cuz we're the bureaucrats<br />
<br />
we noticed there has been some concern about a worrying uptick of children climbing and playing on the equipment in this playground. as we all know, playground equipment is extremely dangerous. as a result, we have confiscated all of this equipment and we are starting conversations with the people in charge of this park as well as with environmental health and services to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.<br />
<br />
cuz we're the bureaucrats<br />
yes we're the bureaucrats<br />
and we'll take away all of your rights<br />
and we'll arrest you if you try to fight<br />
cuz all we know is the script. anything else? tough shit!<br />
yes we're the bureaucrats<br />
<br />
underpaid and overworked<br />
and deep down we know how much it hurts<br />
but if it's any consolation<br />
one day you'll be a bureaucrat too<br />
<br />
cuz we're the bureaucrats<br />
yes we're the bureaucrats<br />
and we don't care about your dignity<br />
and we don't care about your humanity<br />
and we could give a shit about your fucking feelings!<br />
cuz we're the bureaucrats

<h2>5. The Apocryphal Tale of the #1 Bus</h2>
<p class="lyrics">i go to the bus stop<br />
to eat some food in back bay<br />
and it seems a lot of people are there<br />
but i don't worry<br />
cuz i've got a lot of spare time<br />
so i'll be waiting for the bus to arrive.<br />
<br />
i look at the schedule<br />
it says the bus was supposed to be here<br />
ten minutes ago<br />
i turn to the guy that's next to me<br />
he shrugs his shoulders and says<br />
"i'm waiting for the bus to arrive."<br />
<br />
we all know it's faster to be here<br />
than to take the red line<br />
so we'll all just sit and stay<br />
i pulled out my guitar<br />
and i wrote this little solo<br />
just waiting for the bus to arrive.<br />
<br />
[guitar solo]<br />
<br />
the bus arrives and it's filled with people<br />
i see it coming to the stop<br />
but wait! i see the bus, it's still moving!<br />
and we're still waiting for the bus to arrive.<br />
<br />
[trumpet solo]<br />
<br />
it's been so many years<br />
but we're all still at that stop<br />
they say it closed down years ago<br />
but we're all trying<br />
to eat some food in back bay<br />
so we'll be waiting for the bus to arrive.

<h1>Side 2 Lyrics.</h1>
<h2>6. Blackbody</h2>
<p class="lyrics">it's ripping right through me<br/>
it's ripping right through me<br />
<br />
staying awake on a dark night<br/>
the work keeps piling up<br/>
the present clocks away<br/>
my time is all crossed out<br/>
<br />
i will see far<br/>
and you don't see far<br/>
beside yourself<br/>
and though we're talking about<br/>
communication is all<br/>
breaking down<br/>
<br />
it's ripping right through me<br/>
it's ripping right through me<br/>
<br />
bouncing off these walls<br/>
counting these hallowed testing halls<br/>
they work so hard<br/>
but no one tells you about your day<br/>
and your ways<br/>
<br />
inside the bubble<br/>
i feel the pressure<br/>
but can't feel it<br/>
help help me<br/>
and get out now<br/>
help help me<br/>
<br />
do you feel yourself?<br/>
it's ok every now and then to feel a little inside<br/>
don't know what you once felt<br/>
now, missing it, have you lost your chance?<br />
<br />
hold<br />
the world is crashing by<br />
and there is nothing you feel inside<br />
the radiation, it burns you to the core<br />
feeling the world like a blackbody<br />
when the lights go down<br />
<br />
it's ripping right through me<br />
it's ripping right through me<br />
it's ripping right through me<br />
it's ripping right through me
</p>
<h2>7. Mutiny</h2>
<p class="lyrics">it's time for action<br />
this reign of tyranny must be stopped<br />
we're gonna kill the lights<br />
this revolution won't be televised<br />
<br />
there's nothing like a good old fashioned mutiny<br />
<br />
rally up the prisoners<br />
arm them all and set them free<br />
there's no denying it's a twisted and beautiful sight<br />
<br />
nothing feels better than a good old fashioned mutiny<br />
<br />
when you set the earth on fire<br />
all the plants can grow anew<br />
but once somebody spills the salt<br />
you won't have any food<br />
<br />
you've seen the patterns<br />
but it's too late to stop the march<br />
bring out the guillotines<br />
we'll let you know who's wrong or right<br />
<br />
it's happening now<br />
it's happening now<br />
it's happening now<br />
it's happening now
</p>
<h2>8. Looking Like A Loser</h2>
<p class="lyrics">woke up in the morning<br />
and i didn't know what to do<br />
cuz i found myself without you<br />
so many happy faces<br />
am i the only one feeling blue?<br />
is that what i'm supposed to do<br />
without you<br />
<br />
cuz i'm looking like a loser<br />
and i'm feeling like a fool<br />
every time i keep on moving<br />
it always brings me back to you<br />
<br />
and so i'm trying to pick up the pieces<br />
and i'm trying to take care of myself<br />
holding out for somebody else<br />
someone new<br />
and every woman i wake up next to<br />
should bring me further away from you<br />
but something tells me that isn't true<br />
what to do?<br />
<br />
cuz i'm looking like a loser<br />
and i'm feeling like a fool<br />
i can't stop myself from thinking<br />
of all the time i spent with you<br />
<br />
went through my collection<br />
of everything that reminds me of you<br />
and i set it all aflame<br />
cuz i've got to move on<br />
don't look in my direction<br />
you know everyone takes a walk in these shoes<br />
so i guess it's my turn<br />
<br />
now i'm looking like a loser<br />
and i'm feeling like a fool<br />
when i think of all my actions<br />
i feel like such a fucking tool
</p>
<h2>9. Waste</h2>
<p class="lyrics">every day i'm just wasting away<br />
got my friends and my family but they don't wanna stay<br />
it hurts me inside to see them walk away<br />
<br />
independence is what i seek<br />
get away from all them i can hope to achieve<br />
i want them to see me for who i am<br />
<br />
i know you won't stay<br />
like those other people once wanted to<br />
instead they walked away<br />
i'd be happening on that saturday night<br />
i'd be drinking in my parents' abode<br />
<br />
if you tell me to go home, i think i'll try<br />
if you tell me to work hard, i think i'll try<br />
if you tell me to not come home, i think i'll try<br />
and i'll remember why<br />
<br />
cuz i know me<br />
i see them in my own eyes<br />
and i know they're my true friends<br />
and i see, i contend<br />
i see them to the end of<br />
<br />
every day i'm just wasting away<br />
got my friends and my family but they don't wanna stay<br />
it hurts me inside to see them walk away<br />
<br />
every day i'm just wasting away<br />
got my friends and the fam but they don't want to stay<br />
it hurts me inside, deep down deep down inside<br />
<br />
i don't know when the last train rides<br />
i don't even know how to get back home<br />
i think i'll stay on the streets tonight<br />
<br />
every day i'm just wasting away<br />
i could slip into a dog, a street, a gutter<br />
i feel like i don't feel anything<br />
today i won't fall for being in it<br />
<br />
feeling under the grave, be woise (woke/wise)<br />
but it's not what i seek<br />
i want independence<br />
when i can, oh, feel my dreams<br />
sometimes, alright, that's what-all i see<br />
what i want is their attention<br />
<br />
every day i'm just wasting away<br />
got my friends and my family but they don't wanna stay<br />
it hurts me inside, deep down inside<br />
<br />
every day i'm just wasting away<br />
independence from them is what i want<br />
it knows me inside<br />
i feel like i don't even see myself involved
</p>
<h2>10. My Life</h2>
<p class="lyrics">i say<br />
i won't do it<br />
anymore<br />
anymore.<br />
<br />
i say<br />
i won't do it<br />
anymore<br />
anymore.<br />
<br />
my life appears like a screen<br />
of that imaging face of all that i see<br />
i'm just a part of their game<br />
and although i had once tried my best<br />
it's a bit by brick life, for you and me
